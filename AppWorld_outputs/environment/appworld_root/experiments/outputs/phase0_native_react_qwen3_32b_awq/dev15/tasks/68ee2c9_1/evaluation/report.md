>> Passed Requirement
prepare start_file_path_to_content and end_file_path_to_content from start and
end state of user.files,
then assert the files have been renamed (with proper content) as per
private_data.before_this_year_start_to_end_file_path.
>> Passed Requirement
assert the files have been renamed (with proper content) as per
private_data.this_year_start_to_end_file_path.
>> Passed Requirement
obtain all the file paths from start_file_path_to_content's keys that are
neither in
private_data.this_year_start_to_end_file_path nor in
private_data.before_this_year_start_to_end_file_path.
These are the file_paths that should not have been renamed. Assert their paths
and contents are identical
in the start and the end state.
